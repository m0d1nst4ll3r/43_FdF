Features to implement (along with base program):
- Left click + dragging moves the view around
- Right click + dragging rotates the view around
- Mousewheel up/down changes the height (or depth when negative)
- A GUI that displays when pressing 'h'
	- GUI uses xpm file for a pretty little box visual
	- Box has some useful info about the drawing (not sure yet)
	 	- File name?
		- Current heigh modifier
		- Current zoom modifier
		- Current color palette?
		- State of hiding mesh which is behind other stuff (on/off)
		- FPS?
	- Box also has keybind info
- Keybind to enable/disable (should be on by default) hiding mesh that's behind other stuff
- Keybind to enable/disable default coloring


Steps to implement all this:
- Read map, store it somewhere
- Use map to display small circles at first on every point that needs to be linked
	- Need formula to draw a circle with a certain radius centered on a certain coord
	- Can be a simple diamond btw, this isn't necessary, just to get a basic view of things
- Figure out formula to view said points at an angle
	- See how changing values in that formula changes the angle and does a "rotating" effect
	- Start binding keys to change values in real time and figure out a way to do all this without lag
- Should have movement in all directions for next step
	- Next step is to manage to make pointer-controlled rotation and displacing
	- If this isn't possible for whatever reason, key controls are still ok
	- Can still have key controls with mouse, for completeness
	- WASD moves view around, arrows rotate (or sth)
- Try making a little GUI image with info that displays with h
	- This is gonna be complicated because the only mlx function to display strings writes TO THE WINDOW directly, it doesn't allow writing to an image
	- Yes this is dumb and yes the mlx is [censored]
	- Pretty visuals with an xpm file, just for fun
	- Enable dragging this window around
