Most basic version done. Got keyboard hooks set up, mouse hooks set up. Got pointer motion movement.

However, I never really did real isometric graphics. It is MANDATORY in the subject to have an isometric view.

Isometric is 120 degrees between all lines.

I should try to get that, and then implement rotation/zoom (with pointer motion rotation).

Missions for now:
- Rewrite/restructure code to be clearer
	- More sub-structures
	- Better variable names
	- Normed comments (before typedef or function)
	- Use AI to suggest better names - I can improve a lot there

Code has been refactored. Except draw, because draw is the last hurdle.

It is not *perfect*. It's good enough, however. Next projects will be better, learn as you go, yadda yadda.

God struct now has tons of smaller sub-structs. Init and exit functions benefit hugely from this, they are extremely readable.

Map building is not extremely readable, but it's not bad at all. Will do better next time.

Hooks are very readable. Hook key_repeat is not ideal, has a lot of stuff in there including executing keybind actions. Not the best place. But not bad.

Engine loop was insanely improved. It's very clean.

The last hurdle is draw. Drawing functions were simplified a tiny bit, but are still very complex. After draw is fixed though, the project is complete.

Listing steps to project completion:
- Fix draw.c
	- Understand bresenham drawing algorithm fully
	- Fix translation (add x_offset and y_offset AFTER 3D translation)
	- Add zoom (multiply values by zoom before/after translation but before adding offsets)
	- Fix rotation (add 2 modifiers to 3D translation instead of just 1, to rotate 3D at a up/down angle and left/right)
	- Implement RMB rotation (easy)
	- Understand 3D translation algorithm fully
	- Add colors in (send colors to bresenham algorithm, calculate gradient based on where we are in the loop)
	- Make code concise, organized and readable, of course
	- (ADDED 09/02) Remove conditionals in hot loop

Extra stuff I'm not going to do:
- Overlay for rendering info
- (ADDED 09/02) No outside-of-screen calculations (unless it turns out to be really simple once I think about it?)

Trying to refactor draw and add colors.

The two line draw functions were simplified and commented, I understand bresenham now. Colors were added, but look a bit weird because I'm doing simple arithmetic. Working on a better color gradient.

Steps done:
- Understand bresenham

Steps WIP:
- Add colors
- Make code concise

New steps to add:
- Remove conditionals in hot loop, remove pixel_put returning a value.
	- Turns out this is useless and hurts more than anything. Also makes code less readable.
	- Care: cannot remove window boundary conditional because I am drawing lines outside of screen. This is way more complicated than it seems, might work on it.
- Add -O3 to Makefile
	- Should speed up program by 1.5x-2x-3x





10/02/2026

Colors added. Hot loop conditionals removed, img_state removed (now only a bool). Made draw sync with fps (really dumb that it wasn't the case!). Added -O3.

Still boundary conditionals in pixel_put as I am rendering stuff outside of screen (dumb, but to be fixed later).

Summary of TODOs:
- Fix draw.c
	- Fix translation: ez
	- Fix zoom: ez
	- Fix rotation: reading to do
	- Implement RMB rotation: ez once rotation is done, but hard to get good controls in 3D with only 2 axes
	- Build understanding of sin/cos 3D rotation math: reading and thinking to do
	- Improve draw.c code, still: ez

draw.c refactoring draft:
- The 2 line drawing functions are optimized and normed
- The function to choose which drawing function to use and compose points and colors into the arguments is too long
	- Fixed
- I have a transform function to make points into 3D which I think is probably bad
- The function to link points together and decide their x/y is too big and very badly designed
- Draw image function is ok (could eventually grow)
