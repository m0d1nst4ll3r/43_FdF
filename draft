Most basic version done. Got keyboard hooks set up, mouse hooks set up. Got pointer motion movement.

However, I never really did real isometric graphics. It is MANDATORY in the subject to have an isometric view.

Isometric is 120 degrees between all lines.

I should try to get that, and then implement rotation/zoom (with pointer motion rotation).

Missions for now:
- Rewrite/restructure code to be clearer
	- More sub-structures
	- Better variable names
	- Normed comments (before typedef or function)
	- Use AI to suggest better names - I can improve a lot there
