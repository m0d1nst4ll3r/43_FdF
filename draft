Most basic version done. Got keyboard hooks set up, mouse hooks set up. Got pointer motion movement.

However, I never really did real isometric graphics. It is MANDATORY in the subject to have an isometric view.

Isometric is 120 degrees between all lines.

I should try to get that, and then implement rotation/zoom (with pointer motion rotation).

Missions for now:
- Rewrite/restructure code to be clearer
	- More sub-structures
	- Better variable names
	- Normed comments (before typedef or function)
	- Use AI to suggest better names - I can improve a lot there

Code has been refactored. Except draw, because draw is the last hurdle.

It is not *perfect*. It's good enough, however. Next projects will be better, learn as you go, yadda yadda.

God struct now has tons of smaller sub-structs. Init and exit functions benefit hugely from this, they are extremely readable.

Map building is not extremely readable, but it's not bad at all. Will do better next time.

Hooks are very readable. Hook key_repeat is not ideal, has a lot of stuff in there including executing keybind actions. Not the best place. But not bad.

Engine loop was insanely improved. It's very clean.

The last hurdle is draw. Drawing functions were simplified a tiny bit, but are still very complex. After draw is fixed though, the project is complete.

Listing steps to project completion:
- Fix draw.c
	- Understand bresenham drawing algorithm fully
	- Fix translation (add x_offset and y_offset AFTER 3D translation)
	- Add zoom (multiply values by zoom before/after translation but before adding offsets)
	- Fix rotation (add 2 modifiers to 3D translation instead of just 1, to rotate 3D at a up/down angle and left/right)
	- Implement RMB rotation (easy)
	- Understand 3D translation algorithm fully
	- Add colors in (send colors to bresenham algorithm, calculate gradient based on where we are in the loop)
	- Make code concise, organized and readable, of course

Extra stuff I'm not going to do:
- Overlay for rendering info
