Landscape map looks like
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0



Question 1: Do we enforce rectangular maps or do we handle non-rectangular ones?
E.g my map is:
0 0 0
0 1
0 0 0
Is this valid? Do I draw a wireframe with just a missing link somewhere?
If so, how far do we go and how do we handle missing links?
E.g
0   1
1 1  
0 1 0
How would I handle the isolated link? Ignore it?



Question 2: What separators do we accept between values in a map?
What if my map looks like:
0 0 0
0 1  0
0 0 0
The [x3, y2] value has an extra space before it. Is that valid? Do we consider successive spaces the same as one space?
Do we accept tabs instead of spaces?
E.g
0	10	0
0	1	0
0	100	0



Question 3: Do bad maps lead to an error, or do we handle it anyway?
E.g
0 0 0
0 a 0
0 0 0
'a' is not a value, do we throw an error, do we still display something but ignore a? Do we ignore it by skipping it and counting it as essentially a space, or do we count it as a missing link (see question 1)?



Question 4: Do we enforce a limit on values?
E.g
0 2147483647 2147483648



Question 5: Do we accept negative values?
E.g
0 0 0
0 -1 0
0 0 0

Answers:
1. Only handle rectangular map, else error (this is the simplest and most logic)
2. is_space function, any amount of characters, meaning space tab space is fine
3. Bad map = error (simplest)
4. Limit is what fits within an int
5. Yes, this is required in the subject
