## How to do this shit

Reminders:
1. We only handle rectangular maps, any incorrect value causes an error (e.g non-digit value, not an int) - negative values are ok
2. There can be a color code after the value in the form (value,color)
3. We accept any amount of whitespace (isspace) as separators between values
Bonuses:
- View panning
- Zooming
- Rotating
- Height multiplier
- Default colors relative to height (different palettes)

Parsing's easy, but how do we store data?

Array seems simplest, but 1D or 2D? (1D is probably better optimized)

When we have the data, what do we do with it? We have to translate each point's [xy] coord onto our window. Since we want to start with an isometric view, we need to apply an offset to each point.

A good start would be representing the points with dots, to start with. Without wires. A better start would be already having zoom, rotate etc... for the dots.

Once we have the dots set up, we just need to calculate how to link them with wires, and draw that. Then, think about colors.

Btw I haven't mentioned colors yet. Our 1D array can be a struct with just a height value, and a color value. Color value can be -1 if it was never set.







Some thoughts already about rendering:

If I do implement a zoom, how do I implement it?
Wires have a width. They can be represented to be more or less small.
Or their width can just be "1" (1 pixel, never more) no matter the zoom.
In one case, zooming will look like the drawing gets bigger/closer.
In the other, it will look like we are "expanding" space, because the wires will stay as thin and never grow wider.

If the value is so high the point is outside the screen, we still need to draw a wire.

Cool features other than zoom include:

- Keybind to modify how high (or low) the points go (multiplier for height)
- Rotate in all directions (left right, up down)
- Pan view with arrows
- Have default colors relative to height (if color isn't specified in map)
- Different color palettes?
- Changing background color?
