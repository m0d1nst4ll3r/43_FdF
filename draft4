Latest progress, started 27/01

- Maps are NOT rectangular (not all of them)
	- This means I can't use a 1D array to store maps, I *need* a 2D one
	- This also means I need to store every line length
	(or can also have a terminator)
- Atox exists for converting literally everything now
	- Can continue storing height in short instead of int, but whatever

- Most of my parsing code can be re-used, just need to store in 2D and allow all line lengths

Todo:
1. Change code for flexible map
	- Can still be 1D for cache misses, just need to calculate the exact size I need
	- I'll have a 1D map for my data, and a 1D array that memorizes where lines begin
	- The 1D array that memorizes lines can be a struct array with the address and the length of the line (e.g int)
		- Make it an unsigned short and make overflow of that considered a bad map
	- /!\ Change of plans
		- Having a structure is annoying, it'll make parsing my map slow
		- E.g map[y].line[x] -> annoying, map[y][x] would be way better
		- So instead, we have a fake 2D array to do map[y][x]
		- And another 1D array to memorize lengths so len[y] gets you how long line y should be


	- For the order, first we read file, then we pre-emptivey malloc it (doesn't matter if it's bad)
		- We already know the number of lines
	- Then we go through each line, check it for validity and to count number of points
		- Write the length but don't do a malloc yet, we will malloc everything all at once
	- Once we've gone through each line (all valid) and all line lengths are written, malloc the 1D map
		- Then we fill it progressively with each line and write the addresses
2. When this is done, parsing is done and map is written, we can finally move on to the fun part
	- Fun stuff
	- For later



Thoughts:
- Are empty lines allowed?
Take this map:
1 2 3 2 1

1 2 3 2 1
Empty line between the first and last line. What do I do?
This can be "valid" in that I just have an empty line with nothing in it. I just don't link that line's "points" to anything.
But what if I ONLY have empty lines? Then it's kinda stupid to go on..?
But it's also stupid to go on with, for example, just one point. You're just doing nothing there. Displaying nothing.
Same, if you're allowing empty lines, you can have a one point line, an empty line, another one point line.
The easiest/simplest is to just allow such situations and say "hey you gave me an empty map, so here's nothing, fucko"
So let's do that...


Notes:
1. Gotta know, in C programming, assume I'm using a huge structure for my program, which starts in the stack (declared as a regular struct in main) but starts getting passed as address to everything.
	- I write a function that doesn't strictly NEED the address as it just wants to access the data and doesn't want to write it
	- In that case, is it better to pass the struct still as an address, or not?
	- Logic has it that you shouldn't need to, so you shouldn't do it
	- But if you don't do it, then you create a copy of the entire struct somewhere in memory, in the stack
		- Does that make any difference optimization-wise?
		- Is the difference anything more than nanoscopic? Should you care? On principle?
		- Is it not really about the optimization but really just about coding ethics? What's the right answer?
2. How about using bools? Should I start writing code with bools or should I continue using ints?
